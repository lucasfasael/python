10.1109/ojvt.2022.3174546,,,In-Vehicle Sensing for Smart Cars,"Driving safety has been attracting more and more interest due to the unprecedented proliferation of vehicles and the subsequent increase of traffic accidents. As such the research community has been actively seeking solutions that can make vehicles more intelligent and thus improve driving safety in everyday life. Among all the existing approaches, in-vehicle sensing has become a great preference by monitoring the driver’s health, emotion, attention, etc., which can offer rich information to the advanced driving assistant systems (ADAS) to respond accordingly and thus reduce injuries as much/early as possible. There have been many significant developments in the past few years on in-vehicle sensing. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the motivation, applications, state-of-the-art developments, and possible future interests in this research area. According to the application scenarios, we group the existing works into five categories, including occupancy detection, fatigue/drowsiness detection, distraction detection, driver authentication, and vital sign monitoring, review the fundamental techniques adopted, and present their limitations for further improvement. Finally, we discuss several future trends for enhancing current capabilities and enabling new opportunities for in-vehicle sensing.","Xiaolu Zeng,Fengyu Wang,Beibei Wang,Chenshu Wu,K. J. R. Liu,O.

This leads to an increasing evolutionary tendency to change from vehicular networks toward cloud-assisted context-aware vehicular cyberphysical systems. In this article, we first propose a multi-layered context-aware architecture and introduce two crucial service components, vehicular social networks and context-aware vehicular security. Then we propose an application scenario regarding the context-aware dynamic parking services by illuminating the cloud-assisted architecture and logic flow. Finally, we investigate the challenges and possible solutions, including context-aware safety hazard prediction, context-aware dynamic vehicle routing, and context-aware vehicular clouds.","Jiafu Wan,Daqiang Zhang,Dongliang Zhang,Daqiang Zhang,Dongliang Zhang,Daqiang Zhang,Shengjie Zhao,Shengjie Zhao,Laurence T.

10.1109/jsyst.2021.3066776,,,An Efficient Context-Aware Vehicle Incidents Route Service Management for Intelligent Transport System,"The continuous urbanization with extensive dynamic situations on evolving cities, urban, and suburban areas, it is not feasible to categorize the navigation as fastest route, toll-free, and other variants. Metropolitan areas are more prone to traffic congestion, lane blocking, accidents, etc., due to the overcrowding and dynamic change of commuters’ arrival rates. In the metropolitan areas, most of the commuters’ use Google map to reach their desired destinations. It is quite often that route specified by navigation will not be reliable because sometimes due to the inability to update the sudden occurrence of incidents on the routes. Currently, Google map and GPS provide the time required to cover the distance and shortest route to reach the destination. The main issues with the existing Google map are it does not considers the impact of sudden occurrence of incidents, does not show the type of incidents that occurred, clearance time, and optimal routes. These issues are solved by designing an efficient context-aware vehicle incidents route service management for an intelligent transport system. The proposed system takes the context information of incidents, vehicles, weather conditions, roadside units, roads, and so on. This context information will be collected and shared with the nearby vehicles and roadside units using both mobile agents and dedicated short-range communication protocols. The proposed system suggests alternative routes with minimal delay and traffic clearance time and severity of incidents to the commuters. Also, it provides the incident information to the neighborhood vehicles, roadside units, nearby hospitals, ambulance, and members of the victims. The proposed system is exhaustively simulated in objective modular network testbed in C++, simulation of urban mobility, and Veins with different simulation parameters. The proposed system’s simulation results reduce the travel time (7 min) compared to the without the context information system (25 min), least collision rate (0.785%) compared to the existing system, minimizes the traffic clearance time in the incident zone, and uniform distribution of vehicle traffic on the estimated routes.","Suresh Chavhan,Deepak Gupta,Chandana Nagaraju,Rammohan A,Ashish Khanna,Joel J.

The traditional computing paradigm to install edge locations is no longer viable due to incurred latency while decision making, especially in delay-sensitive applications. In this paper, we propose a vehicle-to-vehicle task offloading framework that allows vehicles to utilize computation resources available at nearby vehicles. The objective is to bring fog computing near vehicles to achieve computational efficiency and improve quality of service. To overcome mobility issues, we implement Context-aware opportunistic offloading schemes based on speed, direction, and locality of vehicles. The schemes are compared to random offloading mechanism in terms of efficiency, task completion, failure rate, workload distribution, and waiting time. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in failure rate up to 10% with more tasks completed on vehicles within direct communication range.","Anis Ur Rahman,Asad Waqar Malik,Vishwani Sati,Arpita Chopra,Sri Devi Ravana",Vehicular Communications,2020
10.1109/access.2021.3097146,,,Context-Aware Security for Vehicles and Fleets: A Survey,"Vehicles are becoming increasingly intelligent and connected. Interfaces for communication with the vehicle, such as WiFi and 5G, enable seamless integration into the user’s life, but also cyber attacks on the vehicle. Therefore, research is working on in-vehicle countermeasures such as authentication, access controls, or intrusion detection. Recently, legal regulations have also become effective that require automobile manufacturers to set up a monitoring system for fleet-wide security analysis. The growing amount of software, networking, and the automation of driving create new challenges for security. Context-awareness, situational understanding, adaptive security, and threat intelligence are necessary to cope with these ever-increasing risks. In-vehicle security should be adaptive to secure the car in an infinite number of (driving) situations. For fleet-wide analysis and alert triage, knowledge and understanding of the circumstances are required. Context-awareness, nonetheless, has been sparsely considered in the field of vehicle security. This work aims to be a precursor to context-aware, adaptive and intelligent security for vehicles and fleets. To this end, we provide a comprehensive literature review that analyzes the vehicular as well as related domains. Our survey is mainly characterized by the detailed analysis of the context information that is relevant for vehicle security in the future.","Daniel Grimm,Marco Stang,Eric Sax",IEEE Access,2021
10.1007/978-3-319-94214-8_29,,,Towards Context-Aware Vehicle Navigation in Urban Environments: Modeling Challenges,"Currently, urban vehicle navigation is considered important because smoothness of traffic is needed for the sake of safety and cleanliness of air; in this regard, people essentially count on GPS navigation. Nevertheless, due to signal building shadows, GPS signal disturbances may occur in an urban environment; then alternative navigation options should be considered. It is therefore a matter of context-awareness to establish whether or not GPS navigation is available and adjust the delivered navigation services accordingly. In this paper we propose a top-down approach for modeling context-aware vehicle navigation systems; firstly, a high-level technology-independent conceptual model is derived (featuring context-awareness in general) and then this model is mapped towards corresponding lower-level technical solutions. Even though research materials, touching upon context-awareness or vehicle navigation, can be found in literature, we miss holistic approaches that align high-level (conceptual) goals with navigation-specific (technical) solutions; hence, our proposal is considered a step forward in this regard. We also propose an innovation concerning the technical aspects of navigation. Our proposed approach is partially validated by means of experiments.","Ivan Garvanov,Christo Kabakchiev,Boris Shishkov,Magdalena Garvanova",BMSD,2018

10.1109/iccps54341.2022.00013,,2201.06644,HydraFusion: Context-Aware Selective Sensor Fusion for Robust and Efficient Autonomous Vehicle Perception,"Although autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to revolutionize transportation, robust perception across a wide range of driving contexts remains a significant challenge. Techniques to fuse sensor data from camera, radar, and lidar sensors have been proposed to improve AV perception. However, existing methods are insufficiently robust in difficult driving contexts (e.g., bad weather, low light, sensor obstruction) due to rigidity in their fusion implementations. These methods fall into two broad categories: (i) early fusion, which fails when sensor data is noisy or obscured, and (ii) late fusion, which cannot leverage features from multiple sensors and thus produces worse estimates. To address these limitations, we propose HydraFusion: a selective sensor fusion framework that learns to identify the current driving context and fuses the best combination of sensors to maximize robustness without compromising efficiency. HydraFusion is the first approach to propose dynamically adjusting between early fusion, late fusion, and combinations in-between, thus varying both how and when fusion is applied. We show that, on average, Hydrafusionoutperforms early and late fusion approaches by 13.66% and 14.54%, respectively, without increasing computational complexity or energy consumption on the industry-standard Nvidia Drive PX2 AV hardware platform. We also propose and evaluate both static and deep-learning-based context identification strategies.

This effect is strongly related to the Internet of things framework, introducing concepts such as connected vehicles and future smart cities. Context-aware applications are fundamental in this evolving environment, enabling smart and custom-tailored services for a variety of users. The use of on-board speaker recognition (SR) systems can play a key role in enhancing the customization of in-vehicle applications, by identifying the actual users and personalizing services based on their identity. Driven by this motivation, in this paper we present a performance study of an SR system, designed to face typical challenging conditions of an in-vehicle environment. We propose the design of a robust speaker identification algorithm embedding a smart preprocessing method based on voice activity detection, which can effectively reduce the influence of noise and distance on classification. Results show that our solution is able to efficiently improve the correct classification rate, even in the case of distant audio acquisition and in a variety of noisy environments.","Igor Bisio,Chiara Garibotto,A.

10.1007/s00778-020-00608-7,,,"Context-aware, preference-based vehicle routing","Vehicle routing is an important service that is used by both private individuals and commercial enterprises. Drivers may have different contexts that are characterized by different routing preferences. For example, during different times of day or weather conditions, drivers may make different routing decisions such as preferring or avoiding highways. The increasing availability of vehicle trajectory data yields an increasingly rich data foundation for context-aware, preference-based vehicle routing. We aim to improve routing quality by providing new, efficient routing techniques that identify and take contexts and their preferences into account. In particular, we first provide means of learning contexts and their preferences, and we apply these to enhance routing quality while ensuring efficiency. Our solution encompasses an off-line phase that exploits a contextual preference tensor to learn the relationships between contexts and routing preferences. Given a particular context for which trajectories exist, we learn a routing preference. Then, we transfer learned preferences from contexts with trajectories to similar contexts without trajectories. In the on-line phase, given a context, we identify the corresponding routing preference and use it for routing. To achieve efficiency, we propose preference-based contraction hierarchies that are capable of speeding up both off-line learning and on-line routing. Empirical studies with vehicle trajectory data offer insight into the properties of proposed solution, indicating that it is capable of improving quality and is efficient.","Chenjuan Guo,Bin Yang,Jilin Hu,Christian S.

10.1109/iccve52871.2022.9742971,,,Context-aware vehicle and fleet security combining a Knowledge Graph and an object-oriented model,"A growing number of attacks and the introduction of new security standards, e.g. ISO 21434, are increasingly shifting the focus of industry and research to the cybersecurity of vehicles. Being cyber-physical systems, compromised vehicles can pose a safety risk to occupants and the environment. Updates over the air and monitoring of the vehicle fleet over its entire lifespan are therefore established in current and future vehicles. Elementary components of such a strategy are security sensors in the form of firewalls and intrusion detection systems, for example, and an operations center where monitoring and response activities are coordinated. A critical step in defending against, detecting, and remediating attacks is providing knowledge about the vehicle and fleet context. Whether a vehicle is driving on the highway or parked at home, what software version is installed, or what security incidents have occurred affect the legitimacy of data and network traffic. However, current security measures lack an understanding of how to operate in an adjusted manner in different contexts. This work is therefore dedicated to a concept to make security measures for vehicles context-aware. We present our approach, which consists of an object-oriented model of relevant context information within the vehicle and a Knowledge Graph for the fleet. With this approach, various use cases can be addressed, according to the different requirements for the use of context knowledge in the vehicle and operations center.","Daniel Grimm,Eric Sax",2022 International Conference on Connected Vehicle and Expo (ICCVE),2022
10.3390/ijgi10050336,,,A Dynamic and Static Context-Aware Attention Network for Trajectory Prediction,"Forecasting the motion of surrounding vehicles is necessary for an autonomous driving system applied in complex traffic. Trajectory prediction helps vehicles make more sensible decisions, which provides vehicles with foresight. However, traditional models consider the trajectory prediction as a simple sequence prediction task. The ignorance of inter-vehicle interaction and environment influence degrades these models in real-world datasets. To address this issue, we propose a novel Dynamic and Static Context-aware Attention Network named DSCAN in this paper. The DSCAN utilizes an attention mechanism to dynamically decide which surrounding vehicles are more important at the moment. We also equip the DSCAN with a constraint network to consider the static environment information. We conducted a series of experiments on a real-world dataset, and the experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of our model. Moreover, the present study suggests that the attention mechanism and static constraints enhance the prediction results.","Jian Yu,Meng Zhou,Wang Xin,Guoliang Pu,Chengqi Cheng,Bo Chen",ISPRS international journal of geo-information,2021

Sensor uncertainty is predominantly linked to sensor specifications, and because sensor behaviors change dynamically, the machine learning approach is not suitable for learning them. This paper presents a novel learning approach for predicting sensor performance in challenging environments. The design of our approach incorporates both epistemic uncertainties, which are related to the lack of knowledge, and aleatoric uncertainties, which are related to the stochastic nature of the data acquisition process. The proposed approach combines a state-based model with a predictive model, where the former estimates the uncertainty in the current environment and the latter finds the correlations between the source of the uncertainty and its environmental characteristics. The proposed approach has been evaluated on real data to predict the uncertainties associated with global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs), showing that our approach can predict sensor uncertainty with high confidence.","Mohammed Alharbi,Hassan A.

This paper presents a thorough review of the literature on the car-following models used in prevalent micro-simulation tools for vehicles with both human and robot drivers. Specifically, the car-following logics such as the Wiedemann model and adaptive cruise control technology were reviewed based on the vehicle’s dynamic behavior and driving environments. In addition, some of the more recent “AV-ready (autonomous vehicles ready) tools” in micro-simulation platforms are also discussed in this paper.","Hafiz Usman Ahmed,Ying Huang,Pan Lu",Smart Cities,2021

Within a VANET, communications can potentially alter vehicular mobility and conversely, that the mobility could potentially influence vehicular communications.

This paper provides details on the design of the proposed simulator. Its computational costs are evaluated in terms of events quantities and execution time. The physical (PHY) layer of the proposed simulator shows a more realistic packet success rate (PSR) using bit-level processing techniques when compared with the packet-based NS-3 simulator.

To address this problem, data from global navigation satellite systems and inertial navigation systems (GNSS/INS) were used to gather pseudolabels for semantic segmentation. A very simple dynamics model was used as a simulator, and dynamic parameters were obtained from the linear regression of manual driving records. Segmentation and a dynamic calibration method were found to be effective in easing the transition from a simulation to the real world. Pseudosegmentation labels are found to be more suitable for reinforcement learning models.

Firstly, the vehicle dynamics model considering vehicle speed variation and lane-changing safety distance is established, and the expected lane-changing trajectory model under the curved road is designed simultaneously. Then, taking the yaw rate and longitudinal speed as the control objectives of lateral and longitudinal motions, respectively, the sliding-mode variable structure control method based on Lyapunov stability condition is adopted, and the trajectory tracking controller is designed by combining the inverted method to track the desired lane-changing trajectory. Finally, the lane-changing trajectory model and trajectory tracking controller are verified in simulation platform of CarSim/Simulink and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test bench. The results show that the proposed trajectory tracking control method can perform the lane-changing behavior well under different road curvatures and vehicle speeds while maintaining high trajectory tracking control accuracy.","Pengfei Feng,Huiqing Jin,Linfeng Zhao,Mingyu Lu",Modelling and Simulation in Engineering,2022

To investigate the congestion characteristics of mixed traffic flow with CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs), this paper proposes a cell transmission model to capture and simulate traffic congestion for mixed traffic flow. Firstly, the Newell, adaptive cruise control (ACC), and cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) models are adopted to capture the car-following behavior of different vehicles. Secondly, the fundamental diagram under different penetration rates of CAVs is derived based on car-following models. Then, the cell transmission model (CTM) of mixed traffic flow is developed based on the classical CTM and fundamental diagram of mixed traffic flow. Finally, two simulation methods, mixed traffic flow CTM and micro-simulation, are designed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. Moreover, taking the moving bottleneck on the expressway as an example, the congestion characteristics of mixed traffic flow are analyzed using multiple indexes, such as average travel speed, congestion delay, and congestion scale. The results show the following: (i) CAVs can significantly alleviate traffic congestion, (ii) the duration of the bottleneck is positively correlated with the degree of traffic congestion, and (iii) The traffic congestion assessment results under different model parameters slightly differ, but the impact is negligible.","Yunxia Wu,Yalan Lin,R.

In perceptual task of road vehicle collaboration, vehicle cross-camera matching plays a key role in achieving automatic driving vehicles overview blind zone perception.

The ITS infrastructure is critical yet not immune to both physical and cyber threats. Vehicles are cyber-physical systems which are a core component of ITS, can be either a target or a launching point for an attack on the ITS network. Unknown vehicle security vulnerabilities trigger a race among adversaries to exploit the weaknesses and security experts to mitigate the vulnerability. In this study, we identified opportunities for adversaries to take control of the in-vehicle network, which can compromise the safety, privacy, reliability, efficiency, and security of the transportation system. This study contributes in three ways to the literature of ITS security and resiliency. First, we aggregate individual risks that are associated with hacking the in-vehicle network to determine system-level risk. Second, we employ a risk-based model to conduct a qualitative vulnerability-oriented risk assessment. Third, we identify the consequences of hacking the in-vehicle network through a risk-based approach, using an impact-likelihood matrix. The qualitative assessment communicates risk outcomes for policy analysis. The outcome of this study would be of interest and usefulness to policymakers and engineers concerned with the potential vulnerabilities of such critical infrastructures.","Kaveh Bakhsh Kelarestaghi,Mahsa Foruhandeh,Kevin Heaslip,Ryan M.
